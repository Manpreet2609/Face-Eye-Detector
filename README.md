# Face-Eye-Detector
*Face and Eye Detection with Haar Cascade Classifiers*

Haar cascade is an algorithm that can detect objects in images, irrespective of their scale in image and location. This algorithm is not so complex and can run in real-time. We can train a haar-cascade detector to detect various objects like cars, bikes, buildings, fruits, etc.

####
**In this we've implemented Haarcascade Classifier to: **

1. Detect faces
2. Detect eyes
3. Detect faces and eyes from your webcam in Colab
